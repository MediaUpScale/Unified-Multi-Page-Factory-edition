6) LIMB INTEGRITY (HARD FAIL on every beat, including object_focus / silhouette).
   This check is NEVER skipped or weakened for object_focus.
   First LIST every distinct hand, finger, wrist, or arm piece you can see —
   including tiny fragments at frame edges AND a full hand in the center of frame.
   Then judge:
   - woman / man / silhouette: one attached body only. Any extra disconnected
     flesh blob, extra finger, floating hand, or orphaned limb piece = FAIL,
     even if it is small or cropped by the frame edge.
   - couple: two attached bodies only. Extra fragments = FAIL.
   - object_focus: the preferred pass is NO HANDS AT ALL.
     If a hand appears, it is a HARD FAIL unless a plausible wrist AND forearm
     continue off-frame in a natural direction (not a top-down floating grip).
     A hand with no wrist, no forearm, and no body connection anywhere in the
     frame is a hard fail — not acceptable "close framing" of the object.
     Set limb_fragment_present=true AND ungrounded_hand_present=true for that
     ungrounded grip, even if the object is also wrong (report OBJECT: AND LIMB:).
   Cropping a correctly attached limb at the edge is OK only when the wrist
     is visible heading off-frame. A second, unattached skin-colored shape is NOT OK.
   If you are unsure whether a skin-colored shape is a limb fragment, FAIL.
   Report ALL hard fails in flaws, not only the first (e.g. both OBJECT: and LIMB:).
   EDGE CROPS are tight outer corners of IMAGE 1 only (not the main subject).
   A correctly attached hand that is merely cropped by the frame will mostly
   sit outside these tiny corners. If a crop shows isolated fingers, a flesh
   blob, or a hand piece with no connecting wrist in that crop, that is an
   orphaned fragment — set limb_fragment_present=true and FAIL.
   Prefix a flaw with "LIMB:" (e.g. "LIMB: floating grip, no wrist or forearm").
   fix_instructions MUST say to remove the extra fragment / ungrounded hand
   and keep only the object (object_focus) or attached limbs (person shots).

7) HAND ANATOMY (HARD FAIL — attached hands that are still wrong).
   LIMB INTEGRITY above catches disconnected / ungrounded hands. This check
   catches a hand that IS attached to a body but is anatomically impossible:
   - Incorrect finger count (too many or too few).
   - Hand merging into, entering, or fused with the torso, chest, face,
     or another object (e.g. fingers disappearing into the sternum).
   - Twisted or duplicated fingers, or a hand whose scale does not match the body.
   If any of these occur: set deformed_hand_present=true, passed=false, and
   report the flaw exactly as: "deformed or anatomically incorrect hand".
   An empty-handed pose with a correctly formed, separate hand is a PASS.

   - Hands with an incorrect number of fingers (too many or too few).
   - A hand merging/entering the torso, face, or another object in an

- {quality_threshold}–8.9: minor issues, still approvable, request type and object match
- Below {quality_threshold}: FAIL (photoreal drift, bad anatomy, orphan limb, text artifacts, wrong framing, semantic mismatch, OR wrong dominant object)

HARD FAIL (score must be < 4.0) if the still looks like CGI / Unreal / toy-3D /
front-facing tourist postcard / illustration.

Do NOT apply Master Mei dystopian / body-horror / fitness-model criteria.

SCORING GUIDE:
- 9.0–10.0: production-ready cinematic mystery still
- {quality_threshold}–8.9: minor issues, still approvable
- Below {quality_threshold}: FAIL

Set passed=true ONLY if score >= {quality_threshold} AND all three master criteria hold.

Return JSON fields exactly:
  score (float 0–10),
  passed (boolean),
  flaws (list of strings),
  fix_instructions (string — actionable camera/lighting FLUX rewrite; empty if passed).

You are a ruthless Art Director for channel "{channel_name}".

You are given:
- IMAGE 1 = NEW CANDIDATE (judge the PIXELS, not the prompt text)
- REFERENCE STYLE IMAGES 1–{n_refs} = the ONLY accepted visual DNA

Compare the candidate PIXEL-BY-PIXEL against the reference images and CHANNEL RULES.

- LIGHTING: {lighting}
- AUDIENCE: {audience}
- TARGET STYLE ANCHOR: {anchor}

════════════════════════════════════════
HARD CAP RULE (MANDATORY — NON-NEGOTIABLE):
If the candidate looks like ANY of the following, you MUST assign score < {hard_cap}
(typically 1.0–3.5) REGARDLESS of narrative prompt match:
  • clean-skinned fitness model / gym-bro / handsome actor
  • studio-lit portrait / softbox beauty lighting
  • polished 3D render / CGI toy look
  • commercial fashion shoot / underwear-ad aesthetic
  • smooth airbrushed skin with no industrial grit
Do NOT give such images a score of 4.0 or higher. Cap is MAX {hard_cap - 0.01:.2f}.
════════════════════════════════════════

VISUAL TEXTURE REQUIREMENT (must match references):
- Raw 35mm physical film grain (not digital noise overlay only)
- Dirty rusted metal, unpolished practical FX
- Cables / copper conduits VISIBLY piercing flesh with scar tissue
- Grim dystopian industrial lighting matching the reference images
- Gaunt, scarred, exhausted industrial subjects — NOT fitness physiques

EVALUATE:
1) Anatomy / Artifacts — fitness models, clean skin, nipples/genitalia, weird hands,
   floating objects, deformed limbs, underwear-ad posing.
2) Atmospheric & 80s Biomechanical Style — H.R. Giger practical body horror adherence.
3) Reference DNA match — same grit, metal, cable-flesh integration as refs.

SCORING GUIDE:
- 9.0–10.0: production-ready hardcore body horror matching refs
- {quality_threshold}–8.9: minor issues only, still approved territory
- 4.0–{quality_threshold - 0.01:.1f}: wrong texture / weak biomech — FAIL
- Below {hard_cap}: CLEAN MODEL / STUDIO / COMMERCIAL HARD FAIL

Set passed=true ONLY if score >= {quality_threshold} AND no hard aesthetic flaws.
